    <h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>


<p>We make ourselves a place apart <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspBehind light words that tease and flout, <br>
But oh, the agitated heart <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till someone find us really out.</p>


<p>'Tis pity if the case require <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end <br>
We speak the literal to inspire <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of a friend.</p>


<p>But so with all, from babes that play <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,<br>
So all who hide too well away <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
